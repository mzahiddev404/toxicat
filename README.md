# 🐱 ToxiCat

**Is that safe for your cat?**  
ToxiCat is a full-stack app that helps pet owners check if common household items/substances are toxic to cats.

## ❗ Motivation behind this project; Why I Built This

A persuasive pest control tech once used a spray claiming it was “pet safe.” Hours later, my cat showed signs of toxicity (hiding from light; lethargic). I researched and discovered the active ingredient (Permethrin) is **extremely dangerous to cats**. I built this so no one makes that mistake again.
